      description: This section is automatically generated from the source code using [documentation.js](https://github.com/documentationjs/documentation). This ensures the documentation is always up-to-date, however, types are simplified or incorrect in many cases and each section has its own table of contents. The last part is a consequence of a hack needed to separate modules into their own sections, otherwise all functions would be listed in one giant section without context.
